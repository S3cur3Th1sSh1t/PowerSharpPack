# PowerSharpPack

Many useful offensive CSharp Projects wraped into Powershell for easy usage.

Why? In my personal opinion offensive Powershell is not dead because of AMSI, Script-block-logging, Constrained Language Mode or other protection features. Any of these mechanisms can be bypassed. Since most new innovative offensive security projects are written in C# I decided to make them usable in powershell as well.

So what did i basically do here? 

1) First of all clone each C# Repo.
2) Set the class and main methods public
3) For some projects i merged pull requests with new features or bug fixes or i had to remove environment.exit statements so that the whole powershell process is not killed for missing parameters and so on
4) Afterwards compiling each binary
5) Gzip-compress and base64-Encode the compiled binary base64 and load it in powershell via `[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($DecompressedDecodedBinary)`.

Its a very easy but for many repos time consuming process.

and choose the tool as switch parameter for example:

`PowerSharpPack -seatbelt -Command "AMSIProviders"`

![alt text](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/raw/master/images/Example.JPG)

If you want to pass multiple parameters to the binary you can just use quotation marks like:

`PowerSharpPack -Rubeus -Command "kerberoast /outfile:Roasted.txt"`

If you dont want to load all binaries for reasons you can use the per binary Powershell scripts located in the PowerSharpBinaries folder.
